<p>Control: The organization: <br> </p>
<p>a. Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts to support
organizational missions/business functions: [Assignment: organization-defined information
system account types];<br></p>
<p>b. Assigns account managers for information system accounts;<br></p>
<p>c. Establishes conditions for group and role membership;<br> </p>
<p>d. Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access
authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account;<br></p>
<p>e. Requires approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] for requests to
create information system accounts;<br></p>
<p>f. Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system accounts in accordance
with [Assignment: organization-defined procedures or conditions];<br></p>
<p>g. Monitors the use of information system accounts;<br></p>
<p>h. Notifies account managers:<br></p>
<pre><code>1. When accounts are no longer required;&lt;br&gt;
2. When users are terminated or transferred; and&lt;br&gt;
3. When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes;&lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>i. Authorizes access to the information system based on:<br></p>
<pre><code>1. A valid access authorization;&lt;br&gt;
2. Intended system usage; and1. Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions;&lt;br&gt;
3. Other attributes as required by the organization or associated missions/business functions;
</code></pre>
<p>j. Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency]; and<br></p>
<p>k. Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when
individuals are removed from the group.<br></p>
<p>Supplemental Guidance: Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared,
group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and
service. Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by
organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information
system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security
controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system
accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner,
mission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such
accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other
attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for
<a href="../access_control/">authorizing access</a> include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-oforigin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements
(e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time
zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to
consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency
accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a
part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without
the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in
response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency
account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary
accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used
for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such
accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions
for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or
temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated.
Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training. Related controls:

<p>Control Enhancements:<br></p>
<p>(1) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SYSTEM ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT<br>
The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information
system accounts.</p>
<p>Supplemental Guidance: The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using
email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated
or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using telephonic
notification to report atypical system account usage.</p>
<p>(2) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | REMOVAL OF TEMPORARY / EMERGENCY ACCOUNTS
The information system automatically [Selection: removes; disables] temporary and emergency
accounts after [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and
emergency accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather than at
the convenience of the systems administrator.</p>
<p>(3) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE INACTIVE ACCOUNTS
The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after [Assignment: organizationdefined time period].</p>
<p>(4) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED <a href="../audit_and_accountability/">AUDIT</a> ACTIONS
The information system automatically audits account creation, modification, enabling, disabling,
and removal actions, and notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: <a href="../audit_and_accountability/">AU-2</a>, <a href="../audit_and_accountability/">AU-12</a>.</p>
<p>(5) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | INACTIVITY LOGOUT
The organization requires that users log out when [Assignment: organization-defined time-period
of expected inactivity or description of when to log out].
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: <a href="systems_and_communications_protection.md">SC-23</a>.</p>
<p>(6) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>The information system implements the following dynamic privilege management capabilities:
[Assignment: organization-defined list of dynamic privilege management capabilities].</p>
<p>Supplemental Guidance: In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ
static information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, dynamic access
control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on run time access control
decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management. While user identities may remain
relatively constant over time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing
mission/business requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege
management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges from users, as
opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in
privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the
privileges of users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This
type of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if
users are operating out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress
or in emergency maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the ancillary
effects of privilege changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for
communications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements for information
system resiliency. Related control: <a href="../access_control/">AC-16</a>.</p>
<p>(7) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ROLE-BASED SCHEMES</p>
<pre><code>The organization:
(a) Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access
scheme that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles;
(b) Monitors privileged role assignments; and
(c) Takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] when privileged role assignments are no
longer appropriate.
</code></pre>
<p>Supplemental Guidance: Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals
that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users
are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include, for example, <a href="systems_and_communications_protection.md">key management,
account management, network and system administration, database administration, and web
administration</a>.</p>
<p>(8) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC ACCOUNT CREATION
The information system creates [Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts]
dynamically.</p>
<p>Supplemental Guidance: Dynamic approaches for creating information system accounts (e.g., as
implemented within service-oriented architectures) rely on establishing accounts (identities) at
run time for entities that were previously unknown. Organizations plan for dynamic creation
of information system accounts by establishing trust relationships and mechanisms with the
appropriate authorities to validate related authorizations and privileges. Related control: <a href="../access_control/">AC16</a>.</p>
<p>(9) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF SHARED / GROUP ACCOUNTS
The organization only permits the use of shared/group accounts that meet [Assignment:
organization-defined conditions for establishing shared/group accounts].</p>
<p>(10) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | SHARED / GROUP ACCOUNT CREDENTIAL TERMINATION
The information system terminates shared/group account credentials when members leave the
group.</p>
<p>(11) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | USAGE CONDITIONS
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances and/or usage
conditions] for [Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can describe the specific conditions or circumstances
under which information system accounts can be used, for example, by restricting usage to
certain days of the week, time of day, or specific durations of time.</p>
<p>(12) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ACCOUNT MONITORING / ATYPICAL USAGE
The organization:</p>
<pre><code>(a) Monitors information system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical usage];
and
(b) Reports atypical usage of information system accounts to [Assignment: organization-defined
personnel or roles].
</code></pre>
<p>Supplemental Guidance: Atypical usage includes, for example, accessing information systems
at certain times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage
patterns of individuals working in organizations. Related control: <a href="system_assessment_and_authorization.md">CA-7</a>.</p>
<p>(13) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE ACCOUNTS FOR HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS
The organization disables accounts of users posing a significant risk within [Assignment:
organization-defined time period] of discovery of the risk.</p>
<p>Supplemental Guidance: Users posing a significant <a href="../risk_assessment/">risk</a> to organizations include individuals for
whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access
to information systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm
includes potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, or the Nation. Close coordination between authorizing officials, information
system administrators, and human resource managers is essential in order for timely execution
of this control enhancement. Related control: <a href="../personnel_security/">PS-4</a>.</p></div>
